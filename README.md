# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

This repository is a centralized collection of my projects, reports, and analyses from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program. These documents demonstrate my foundational skills in key cybersecurity domains, including risk management, incident response, network analysis, and vulnerability assessment.

### **1. Risk Management & Auditing**

* **Vulnerability Assessment Report:** Analyzed a critical database server to identify vulnerabilities and propose a remediation strategy.
* **Security Risk Assessment Report:** Created a report recommending methods like MFA and strong password policies to harden an organization's security posture.
* **Risk Register:** Developed a risk register for a bank, identifying and prioritizing potential threats based on likelihood and severity.
* **Botium Toys Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report:** Audited Botium Toys' security controls and adherence to standards like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC.
* **Home Asset Inventory:** Created a comprehensive inventory of a home network's assets to identify vulnerabilities and assign sensitivity levels.
* **Botium Toys Internal Audit Report:** Documented the findings from an internal audit to assess the company's security posture.

### **2. Incident Response**

* **Incident Report Analysis:** Investigated a DDoS attack and detailed the response using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
* **Security Incident Final Report:** A final report on a security incident that includes the investigation findings and a recovery plan.
* **Incident Handler's Journal:** A journal entry detailing the handling of specific security events.
* **PASTA Worksheet Task:** Used the PASTA framework to analyze a phishing attempt and recommend the appropriate action.
* **Data Leak Worksheet:** Analyzed a data leak incident, identified the control that was breached, and provided remediation recommendations.
* **Parking Lot USB Exercise:** Analyzed the risks associated with a "parking lot USB" social engineering attack and proposed mitigation strategies.
* **Hash File Investigation Findings:** A presentation on a security investigation, including file hash analysis and threat intelligence.

### **3. Network & System Analysis**

* **Cybersecurity Incident Report - Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyzed network traffic from a `tcpdump` log to determine the root cause of a website outage.
* **SQL Queries to Analyze Login Attempts:** Used SQL queries to investigate failed login attempts and analyze user activity.
* **File Permissions in Linux:** A project detailing how to use Linux commands to check and modify file permissions.
* **Update a file through a Python algorithm:** Created a Python script to automate the process of updating a file of approved IP addresses.
